Haiku video editing software.

UltraDV is a full-featured non-linear video editing application created by Mediapede Inc in 1998. Features include 8 tracks of video, video capture, audio capture, transitions, real-time preview, and much more. The goal of this project is to complete the port to Haiku, and also provide a showcase for the awesomeness of the Haiku media server.
